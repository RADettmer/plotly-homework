BELLY BUTTON BIODIVERSITY


In this assignment, an interactive dashboard was created to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.  

There doesn't seem to be an information in this data set indicating wether there is any difference between an innie or an outie.

OTU is short for operational taxonomic units, a  small handful of microbial species that lives in navels.


Files included are as follows.

IMAGES:

Bar plot of name 956 - top ten OTUs.

Gauge of name 956 - washing frequency

EXAMPLES OF THREE PAGES.

Bellybutton Biodiversity name 1584

Bellybutton Biodiversity name 940 (also the home page)

Bellybutton Biodiversity name 956

THOUGHTS:

This was a challenging but cool assignment.  It was difficult thinking through the process but fun figuring out the colors and layout.

The most difficult but rewarding was getting the gauge to work.  I think I spent the most time on this fiddling with the color scheme.

If you notice, the delta in the gauge changes to up and green once the subject, like name 956 does, once the washing frequency goes above 5.
