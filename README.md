###Belly Button Biodiversity


In this assingmnet, an interactive dashboard was created to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.  

There doesn't seem to be an information in this data set indicating wether there is any difference between an innie or an outie.

OTU is short for operational taxonomic units, a  small handful of microbial species that lives in navels.


Files included are as follows.
