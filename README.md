## This homework/project creates a dashboard using Plotly, D3.js and JavaScript.

Here is a link to the dashboard: https://radettmer.github.io/plotly-homework/

<P>In this assignment, an interactive dashboard was created to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.  
OTU is short for operational taxonomic units, a  small handful of microbial species that lives in navels.
There isn't any information in this data set indicating wether there is any difference between an innie or an outie.
Data source was . . . . (fill in here)

Bellybutton Biodiversity name 940 (also the home page)

## Thoughts:
<p>This was a challenging but cool assignment.  It was difficult thinking through the process but fun figuring out the colors and layout.
The most difficult but rewarding was getting the gauge to work.  I think I spent the most time on this fiddling with the color scheme.
If you notice, the delta in the gauge changes to up and green once the subject, like name 956 does, once the washing frequency goes above 5.
